      "description": "An extensive collection and visual record of images generated by series of representation and associations within the culture. \n The project expands from; multi-disciplinary discussions and moving scenarios in contemporary culture; The fashion context; and the integration of designed objects into everyday situations/ denim definition. \n The research expands on the notion of abstracting the semiotic of denim archetypes; Reflecting on the process of isolating the elements of denim associations, and question how its parts play a role in collective perceptions. \n The meaning behind the outcomes is to interrogate how the signs of denim artifacts signify, and how denim visual notions becomes movable. These outcomes intentionally open a space for discussion and a opportunity for recollection of multiple collective perceptions. \n Also, the body of work suggests “reciprocal language” always relating to the imaginary of denim, its technology, production, and replication.\n Each project within the work acts as a reflection and intervention upon its foundations. It rewrites and creates narratives by finding evidence self-contained.\n The process is a developed by a system that is continually shifting from fashion context, everyday design, and towards denim design principles which intentionally leave room for interpretation. Suggests multiple readings, and experiments with applications in contemporary culture.",
